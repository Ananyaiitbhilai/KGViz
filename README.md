## KGViz Tool
This innovative application harnesses the power of local open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize the way we visualize and understand complex data. By extracting meaningful triples from unstructured text, the app constructs intricate knowledge graphs that reveal the hidden connections and insights within the data. Accepted at the prestigious Text2KG 2024 workshop at the Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC), this tool stands at the forefront of semantic technology, offering a unique approach to data analysis and representation.

The application's core functionality lies in its ability to parse through vast amounts of text and intelligently identify relationships between entities, effectively transforming raw information into a structured and interactive knowledge graph. This not only enhances the accessibility of data but also provides a more engaging and intuitive way for users to explore and interpret the underlying patterns and trends. Whether for academic research, business intelligence, or personal use, this application offers a cutting-edge solution for anyone looking to unlock the full potential of their data through the power of LLM-driven knowledge graph visualization.
