# KGViz Tool
This innovative application harnesses the power of local open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize the way we visualize and understand complex data. By extracting meaningful triples from unstructured text, the app constructs intricate knowledge graphs that reveal the hidden connections and insights within the data. The approach employed in the backend got accepted at the Text2KG 2024 workshop at the Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC), this tool stands at the forefront of semantic technology, offering a unique approach to data analysis and representation. This tool is an extension of the framework/code submitted at Text2KG.

The application's core functionality lies in its ability to parse through vast amounts of text and intelligently identify relationships between entities, effectively transforming raw information into a structured and interactive knowledge graph. This not only enhances the accessibility of data but also provides a more engaging and intuitive way for users to explore and interpret the underlying patterns and trends. Whether for academic research, business intelligence, or personal use, this application offers a cutting-edge solution for anyone looking to unlock the full potential of their data through the power of LLM-driven knowledge graph visualization. 

It transforms text into RDF (Resource Description Framework) tuples, which are then visually differentiated based on their occurrence frequency. This method results in a vibrant and informative display that not only enhances data comprehension but also adds an aesthetic dimension to the analysis. Users can effortlessly download these RDF tuples in a JSON format, facilitating seamless integration and further analytical exploration. This feature ensures that the data is not only visually appealing but also practical and ready for use in various applications, from data science projects to software development.
